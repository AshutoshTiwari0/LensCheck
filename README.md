# 🧠 Cataract Detection using CNN 

This project is a **image-based catarcat classification app** that uses **Deep Learning** and **Streamlit** to detect signs of cataract in images.  


---

## 🚀 Features  
- Classifies image into **2 categories**:  
  - Cataract
  - Normal 
- Web app deployment support (via `app.py`, `Procfile`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
